VMware TalentBoost 2019 Final task. CRUD application Spring + Angular + MySQL.

Configure:
DataBase connection:
This application uses MySQL DataBase and Spring's JPA to handle the connection.
application.properties file must be configured so JPA knows the url,username and password

sample configuration:

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/Memes
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=1234

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

/Memes after the url is the DataBase, which must be created by whoever runs the application.
JPA's hibernate.ddl should be on either 'create' or 'update' and it will configure the tables and columns itself.

Next configuration in application.properties is the host on which the app runs.
By default it is server.port=6789(overriding spring's OOTB 8080).
Configuration of this parameter is not mandatory as 6789 isn't default port for most stuff.
Angular is bundled with Springboot and should start on this port aswell.

Next configuration is the path to the public exposed resources.
resources.address=file:///C:/MemeWorld/Images/
this parameter is used by 'resourceFolderUrl' withing Application.class to point to the directory from which the images 
are accessable to the web so that the explore tab may work.
The whole application is within "MemeWorld" folder and "Images" folder is right inside that,along with the API and
the code for Angular. Changing the resource directory is not recommended as it will require changes on some other
places aswell, so just make sure the path points to "somepath//MemeWorld/Images/" and the "file:///"
is mandatory at least for windows.

Final configuration is the public static final String 'myServerAddress' variable within the Application class.
this should be the IP and the port you are running the application from. By default port is 6789.
This variable is then mapped to the Meme's Image's urls upon sending them to Angular or external app
or used when register method in domain service is called.
This is the reason why there must be exposed folder with resources.

    public  static final  String myServerAddress = "http://192.168.1.5:6789";

Recap:
application.properties:
1.
DataBase configuration
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/Memes
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=1234

where the DataBase must be already created. JPA should take care of the tables and columns.

2. Server port if changes are required
server.port=6789

3.resources.address 
must point file"///something/MemeWorld/Images/

resources.address=file:///C:/MemeWorld/Images/

and Application.class:
myServerAddress must point to the IP Spring is runned with along with "http://" and the port.

public  static final  String myServerAddress = "http://192.168.1.5:6789";

______________________________________________________________________________

Angular is bundled with Spring and it's files are placed under resources/static folder in Spring and will
start along with the Spring Application on the same port.
